Introduction
============

PTT (Partial Thromboplastin Time) Advisor is one of the first of a handful of iOS apps to be released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  PTT Advisor has been a collaboration between two groups at CDC (Informatics R&D and Laboratory Science), and one partner team (Clinical Laboratory Integration into Healthcare Collaborative - CLIHC).  The application offers clinicians a resource to quickly select the appropriate follow-up tests to evaluate patients with a prolonged PTT and a normal prothrombin time (PT) laboratory result, and was designed leveraging best practices in user experience (UX) design and mobile application development.  The goal of the application is to rapidly disseminate the diagnostic algorithms developed by the CLIHC Diagnostic Algorithms subgroup in a convenient and intuitive medium for clinicians. 


Installation and Building
=========================

The PTT source code was built using Xcode 4.3.2 running on Apple Mac OS X Lion 10.7. The application was targeted for use on the iPhone or iPod Touch iOS devices.
