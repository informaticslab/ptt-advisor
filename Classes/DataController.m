Since vWF transports factor VIII in the circulation, the PTT may be prolonged if factor VIII is significantly decreased with vWF. It is recommended to interpret a patientâ€™s result based on the expected level for his/her blood type. Type 2N vWD is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in vWF which leads to decreased binding and increased proteolysis of factor VIII in the circulation. Acquired vWD may also be considered. Depending on the age of the patient, it may be difficult to differentiate congenital from acquired vWD. The distinction is aided by review of family history and evaluation for the presence of underlying conditions such as multiple myeloma, lymphoproliferative malignancies, mitral valve prolapse, hypothyroidism, and several drugs, which are associated with acquired VWD. The National Institutes of Health has recently published a comprehensive review of the diagnosis and management of patients with vWD (Am J Hematol. 2009 Jun;84(6):366-70).");
